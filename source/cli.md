# CLI
The Command Line Interface itâ€™s a very useful tool for invoking some operations 
in the smart contracts such as posting sell/buy orders, and to extract some 
information from them (for example getting the status of a token pair).

It can be used in test nets like `rinkeby` or in `mainnet`.

The easiest way to use the CLI is to follow the steps described in 
[DutchX Example: How to use the CLI ](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-cli).

The CLI logic is implemented in the [DutchX Services](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-services),
for more information checkout [DutchX as an open platform](./dutchx-as-an-open-platform.html)

Although the CLI is a very useful took to do some basic interactions with the
smart contracts, to build tools, bots or services that interact with the 
DutchX, it's a better approach to [Build on top of the DutchX](./build-on-top-of-dutchx.html)
