# Use DutchX as an Oracle
For starting this guide, you should be already familiar with how to
[Build on top of the DutchX](./build-on-top-of-dutchx.html). Please, complete 
first that guide before you start with this one.

Once you know how to create a project that depends on the DutchX, and you know
how to migrate the contracts for local development, we are ready to use the 
contract from our project.

One simple use of the DutchX can be to use it as a onchain price oracle. 

Learn how to get the price for any token pair from the DutchX following the 
steps described in this project [Use DutchX as an Oracle](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/02_use-dx-as-an-oracle)
