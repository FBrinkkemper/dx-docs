# Run your own bots for DutchX
The bots are series of small applications that run in the background and have a 
scoped task to fulfill. 

They interact with the DutchX performing some operations.

For example the **liquidity bots** watch some markets and provide liquidity ensuring
the auctions run continuosly and the prices don't drop below market price.

Running the bots is important for markets were there's insufficient volume or a
market maker in place.

The bots are implemented in 
[DutchX Services](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-services) project and are Open 
Source for anyone to use, modify or improve.
