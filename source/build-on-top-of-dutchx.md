# Build on top of the DutchX
To follow this guide, you should be familiar with:
* Basics of the Ethereum network
* Truffle projects
* Node and NPM

**Create your new cool-app**

The easiest way to get started is to create a new node project that depends on
the [DutchX Smart Contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-contracts/tree/master/contracts)
project.

The DutchX is available as a
[NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnosis.pm/dx-contracts) with:
* All the compiled contracts (ABI, meta info, addresses)
* Migration code (useful for `development`)
* Some scripts

You can create your `cool-app` following the steps
described in this project:
[Build on top of the DutchX](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/01_build-of-top-of-dx)

Once you have the guide completed, a good idea is continuing with this guide
[Use DutchX as an Oracle](./use-dutchx-as-an-oracle.html).
