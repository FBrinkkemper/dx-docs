# Develop on top of DutchX
For folowing this, you should be familiar with:
* Basics about Ethereum network
* Truffle projects
* Node and NPM

## Create your new cool-app
The easiest way to get started is to create a new node project that depends on
the [dx-contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-contracts/tree/master/contracts) 
project.

**DutchX** publish a NPM package with:
* All the compiled contracts (ABI, meta info, addresses)
* Migration code (useful for `development`)
* Some scripts

So Just follow the steps and create your `cool-app` out of this example:
[https://github.com/gnosis/dx-example-use-contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-example-use-contracts)
